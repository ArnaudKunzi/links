# Useful stuff for github and/or git

[Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) a bookdown site from Jenny Bryan. Particularly useful are 
 - [Connect RStudio to git and github](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
 - chapters 15-17 on projects (I generally go down the route of [chapter 16](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html))

[Learning git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a nice interactive tool for learning git

[OH MY GIT!](https://ohmygit.org/) game for learning git
